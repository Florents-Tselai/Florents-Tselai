### Hi there üëã

I'm Florents, and I'm based in Greece.

My toolbelt combines Unix, Python, Postgres, and lots of common sense.

I have a particular interest in web crawling & scraping. 

Some of my open-source projects are

* [babar](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/babar): üêò‚ù§Ô∏èüêç Babar is a Python library that transforms any Python object into a Postgres extension.
* [PyPgConfig](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/PyPGConfig): `PyPgConfig` offers Pythonic access to `pg_config`.
* [cookiecutter-postgres-extension](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/cookiecutter-postgres-extension): A cookiecutter template for a Postgres extension
* [pgJQ](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/pgJQ): A Postgres extension that brings jq to Postgres and SQL
* [WarcDB](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/WarcDB): A tool that serves crawl data as SQLite databases.
* [vasco](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/vasco): A Postgres extension that brings correlation discovery to another level.
* [setup-postgres-PL/Python](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/setup-postgres-plpython): GitHub Action for PL/Python-based Postgres extensions


My favorite project is [diofanti.org](https://diofanti.org) :
