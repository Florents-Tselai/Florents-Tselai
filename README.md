I'm Florents, and I'm based in Greece.

I build data tools for a living. 
Usually with Postgres.
My interests lie somewhere between database engineering, AI, web crawling, and data journalism.

I have research, engineering, and leadership experience across the entire data supply chain, 
from modeling and applying machine learning algorithms to engineering and managing production deployments of big data pipelines.

Some companies I have worked for or consulted for include BCG, Deutsche Telekom, BASF, GfK, XING, BMW, and Advantest, among others. 
My professional profile is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florentstselai/).
