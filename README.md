I'm Florents, and I'm based in Greece.

My toolbelt combines Unix, Python, Postgres, and lots of common sense.

I have a particular interest in web crawling & scraping.
For the last few months, I've been busy bringing Python and Postgres closer together.

Some of my open-source projects are
* [pgllm](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/pgllm): pgllm: Use LLMs in Postgres
* [tsellm](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/tsellm): tsellm: Use LLMs in SQLite and DuckDB
* [liteJQ](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/liteJQ): `jq` extension for SQLite.
* [pgJQ](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/pgJQ): A Postgres extension that brings jq to Postgres and SQL
* [WarcDB](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/WarcDB): A tool that serves crawl data as SQLite databases.
* [vasco](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/vasco): A Postgres extension that brings correlation discovery to another level.
* [cookiecutter-postgres-extension](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/cookiecutter-postgres-extension): A cookiecutter template for a Postgres extension


My favorite project is [diofanti.org](https://diofanti.org) : 
A tool that monitors public spending in the Greek government.
