### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Florents, and I'm based in Greece.

I typically work on Data Special Ops projects as a consultant.
Reach out if we could work together on something interesting.

My toolbelt combines Unix, Python, Postgres, and lots of common sense.

I have a particular interest in web crawling & scraping. 

Some of my open-source projects are

* [pgJQ](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/pgJQ): A Postgres extension that brings jq to Postgres and SQL
* [WarcDB](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/WarcDB): A tool that serves crawl data as SQLite databases.
* [vasco](https://github.com/Florents-Tselai/vasco): An extension that brings correlation discovery to another level.

The project I'm mostly proud of is [diofanti.org](https://diofanti.org) : 
A tool that monitors public spending in the Greek government.

You can find more about me at [tselai.com](https://tselai.com) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florentstselai/).
